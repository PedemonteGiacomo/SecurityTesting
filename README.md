# SecurityTesting
This repo will contain all the works related to Security Testing

# TODO
1.  Modify the path to create a directory containing all the pages
2.  Check if those injections are correct or if any more could be inserted
3.  [BONUS - not mandatory] Blind Command Injection
    You can inject any command you want. My suggestion is to go with "whoami", which has an easier (and more recognizable) output.

    [BONUS - not mandatory] You will notice that some pages (e.g., ping*.php ones) are slow to test. If you want, you can try to make the test more efficient, for example by adding concurrency (e.g., via the asyncio module) 

    [BONUS 2 - also not mandatory] If you want to go above and beyond, fix the vulnerabilities in the attached application, and also hand in your fixed code. 
4. Make a good report of all those injections tests
